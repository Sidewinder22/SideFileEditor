Hi everyone!

This is a simple program type of "proof of concept".  
I create this project to learn more about C++ (14/17/20) and QT5 library.


*This project require: Qt library, qmake and make tools.*

### Build instruction
1. Build the source:  
    ```bash
    $ qmake
    $ make  
    ```
2. Run project:
    ```bash
    $ ./SideFileEditor
    ```
